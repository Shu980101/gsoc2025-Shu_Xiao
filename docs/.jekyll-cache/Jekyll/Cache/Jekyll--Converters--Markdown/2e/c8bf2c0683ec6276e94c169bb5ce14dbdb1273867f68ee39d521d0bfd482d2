<h2 id="what-did-i-do-in-this-period">What did I do in this period?</h2>

<p>Discussed and planned my <abbr title="Google Summer of Code">GSOC</abbr> work with the mentors. I also had my first meeting with my mentors, they are very helpful and supportive. Got familiar with the codebase and other web technologies involved. Learned how to add a sensor to a robot, created a simple PyQt5 widget, and learned <abbr title="Robot Operating System">ROS</abbr>-Control. I started working on the <abbr title="RoboticsAcademy Docker Image">RADI</abbr>-noetic focussing on the drone exercises. Iâ€™ve opened an <a href="https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy/issues/977">issue</a> and making the changes required.</p>

<p class="read-more">Continue with <a href="../extras/community-bonding-usage-and-video-demonstration.md" class="heading flip-title">Usage and Video Demonstration of the Qt widget</a></p>

<h2 id="ok-whats-next">OK, Whatâ€™s next?</h2>

<p>Currently, the drone model spawns correctly but the drone does not takeoff. Continue working on the <abbr title="RoboticsAcademy Docker Image">RADI</abbr>-noetic issue. The coding period begins on 7th June, and I am really looking forward to having a great time ahead.</p>
