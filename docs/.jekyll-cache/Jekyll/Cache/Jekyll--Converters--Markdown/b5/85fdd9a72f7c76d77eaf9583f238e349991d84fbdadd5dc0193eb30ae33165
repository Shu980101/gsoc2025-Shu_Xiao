<p>This week I started by extending the changes of <abbr title="RoboticsAcademy Docker Image">RADI</abbr>-2.4.3 to <abbr title="RoboticsAcademy Docker Image">RADI</abbr>-noetic in <a href="https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy/pull/1051">PR #1051</a> which includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>3 new exercises: Labyrinth Escape, Position Control and Car Junction</li>
  <li>New connection protocol on drones exercises</li>
  <li>Browser cache control</li>
  <li>RTF indicator in all exercises</li>
  <li>User Interface and performance improvements</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy/issues/1021">issue #1021</a> [<strong>connection protocol over drone exercises</strong>] is closed but however a new issue must be created for the multi-drone exercises (currently only the drone-cat-mouse) because <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">commander check</code> only works good for a single drone model without somekind of identity number or vehicle name.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy/issues/977">issue #977</a> [<strong>iris models are spawned correctly but the drone does not take off through the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) takeoff method</strong>] is solved for every drone exercises except the drone-cat-mouse exercise. The sitl problem remains with the mouse [iris-red] model. For other exercises, it was solved by fixing the path of the PX4-<abbr title="Software In The Loop">SITL</abbr> startup  script in <a href="https://github.com/JdeRobot/drones/pull/125">PR #125</a></p>

<p>This week I also migrated the Rescue People exercise from <abbr title="Robot Operating System">ROS</abbr>-node to Web-template based. The goal of this exercise is to implement the logic that allows a quadrotor to recognize the faces of lost people and save their locations in order to perform a subsequent rescue maneuver. Here is a teasor video of the rescue people exercise in web-template:</p>
