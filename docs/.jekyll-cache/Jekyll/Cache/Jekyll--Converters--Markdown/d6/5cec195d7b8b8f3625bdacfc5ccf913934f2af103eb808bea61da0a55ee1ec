<p>Hello there, I am <a href="https://github.com/Shu980101">Shu Xiao</a>, a Master’s student in Robotics and Advanced Construction at IAAC (Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia), Spain. My work focuses on autonomous robotic manipulation using ROS2, MoveIt2, and Docker. Over the past year, I’ve actively contributed to the RoboticsAcademy community, especially in the context of computer vision and pick-and-place exercises.</p>

<p><a href="https://jderobot.github.io/">JdeRobot</a>’s <a href="https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy">Robotics-Academy</a> is a framework for learning robotics and computer vision. It consists of a collection of robot programming exercises using Python language where the student has to code the behavior of a given (either simulated or real) robot to fit some task related to robotics or computer vision. It uses standard middleware and libraries as ROS and OpenCV, so the student learns the state-of-the-art tools.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/TheRoboticsClub/gsoc2025-Shu_Xiao">goal</a> of this project is to migrate the Machine Vision exercise from ROS1 + MoveIt1 to a ROS2 + MoveIt2-based architecture using Docker. The updated exercise will feature a redesigned Python API for students, an intuitive GUI for vision and manipulator control, and clearer documentation. This upgrade will improve usability, enable better debugging, and align the exercise with the current Robotics Academy structure (v2.3). The aim is to make robotics education more accessible, hands-on, and aligned with industry standards.</p>
